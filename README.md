# Tipping Trends: Decoding Passenger Gratuity in NYC Taxis

# **Overview**
This project objectives is to uncover the tipping trends to boost NYC taxi driver earnings and service strategies by comparing tips by time (rush hour, weekends, holidays), linking tip amounts to trip factors (distance, duration, time of day), and identifying  most common tip percentage and passenger tipping rates.

# **Dashboard**
You can view and interact with the interactive Tableau dashboard here:  
[Interactive Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/NYCTaxiTippingTrends/MainDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  
The dashboard visualizes the key findings of the analysis, offering interactive charts and trends on tipping behavior and time analysis.

# **Main Findings**
1. Rush hour shows slightly higher median tips ($2.04) versus non-rush hours ($2.00).
2. Holiday periods show no difference in median tips ($2.00 for both).
3. Trip distance and duration show negligible correlation with tip amounts.
4. Evening periods yield highest median tips ($2.20), while late-night show lowest ($0.05).
5. The most common tip percentage is 23% of fare amount.
6. Approximately 60% of passengers leave tips.
7. Weekends and weekdays show identical median tips ($2.00).

# **Implications and Suggestions**
1. Capitalizes on the higher evening tips while improving service quality during peak demand by increasing driver commission split (+10%) during evening rush hour.
2. Prompt passengers to tip at the most common percentage via preset options.
3. implement surge pricing to compensate for extremely low tips ($0.05 median) during late-night trips.
4. Bundle gratuity into late-night fares to offset the near-zero tipping rate, or introduce a "late-night safety fee."
5. Create targeted marketing campaign to promote gratuity during holidays.
